Open sourcing [StudioJoy](http://studiojoy.net)

Guru is the open source version of StudioJoy, a CMS application for Martial Arts Studios. Guru was my initial 'working name' for StudioJoy so I chose to leave it when open sourcing.

To read more about the reasoning/development of Guru/StudioJoy checkout my [blog](http://www.markphelps.me/2014/11/09/failure.html).

### TODO
- Make easier to run locally (docker?)
